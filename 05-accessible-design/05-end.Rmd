# Ring-tailed Lemurs

.pull-left[

- Among ring-tailed lemurs, single dominant females lead large groups of up to 30 lemurs.

- When traveling as a group on the ground, lemurs hold their tails high like flags to keep the large group together.

- The Duke Lemur Center provides more information on the [Ring-tailed Lemurs species page](https://lemur.duke.edu/accordions/ring-tailed-lemurs-species-page/)
