Hello! My name is Avahi Cleesei and I'm a Bemahara woolly lemur working as a researcher at Bemahara University in Madagascar. I'm excited to be here at useR!2021 to present some data collected by the Duke Lemur Center.

This slide uses:
- the `inverse`, `middle`, and `center` slide classes
- an image inserted with html

# The Avahi cleesei lemur

> A species of woolly lemur native to western Madagascar, named after [actor-comedian] John Cleese...mainly because of Cleese's fondness for lemurs...and his efforts at protecting and preserving them.

> This diurnal animal...has brown skin with white regions on the rear and inside of the thighs and has a short damp nose, large plate eyes, and ears which hardly stand out from the skin.

Some facts about **lemurs**

1. Lemurs are considered _living fossils_ because they provide key clues about primate evolution

1. Lemurs are endemic to only Madagascar

1. 95% of lemur species are at risk of extinction

# Tables

The `lemur_data` dataset contains life histories for a variety of lemurs housed at the [Duke Lemur Center](https://lemur.duke.edu/about/history-mission/) in North Carolina, USA.

```{r lemur-births, echo=FALSE}
lemurs <- readRDS("lemurs.rds")

lemurs %>%
  arrange(desc(age_at_wt_y)) %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'html')
```

- an R code chunk to produce the HTML table
- the `.footnote[]` class

# Highlighting code

`> Inline code is differentiated by a monospace font face`

You can highlight lines of code within code chunks using `#<<` which adds a yellow background:

### Code

```r
lemurs %>% filter(birth_type != "unknown") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dob, fill = birth_type)) +
  geom_histogram() +              #<<
  minimal_theme()
```

### Output

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
lemurs %>% filter(birth_type != "unknown") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dob, fill = birth_type)) +
  geom_histogram() +               #<<
  minimal_theme()
```

???
This slide uses:
- inline code highlighting with backticks ` `` `
- a code chunk to produce a ggplot

---

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6.5, fig.width=14, fig.alt="Histogram of unique lemur births between 1975 and 2019 showing more births took place in captivity than in the wild, with most births concentrated between 1975 and 2000. Births in the wild peaked near 1985 at almost 300 births and again near 2012 at about 100 births. Births in captivity had a plateau between 1980 and 1985 at about 25 births"}
lemurs %>% filter(birth_type != "unknown") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dob, fill = birth_type)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal()
```

???
This slide uses:
- a code chunk to produce a ggplot
- code chunk option `fig.height = 6.5` and `fig.width = 14` to control the figure height and width
